#### 3.1.3 
Where the conditions of Article 3.1.2 are not met, the Financial Accounting Net Income or Loss is the net income or loss determined for a Constituent Entity in preparing Consolidated Financial Statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity and shall not include consolidation adjustments attributable to:

- (a) intragroup transactions unless Article 3.2.8 applies;
- (b) purchase price allocation where a Group Entity acquires a Controlling Interest in an Entity as a result of a business combination, unless the following conditions are satisfied:

#### 3.1.4 
If it is not reasonably practicable to determine the Financial Accounting Net Income or Loss for a Constituent Entity based on the accounting standard used in the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity in accordance with Article 3.1.3, the Financial Accounting Net Income or Loss for the Constituent Entity for the Fiscal Year may be determined using another Acceptable Financial Accounting Standard or an Authorised Financial Accounting Standard (adjusted to prevent Material Competitive Distortions) if:

- (a) the financial accounts of the Constituent Entity are maintained based on that accounting standard;
- (b) the information contained in the financial accounts is reliable; and
- (c) permanent differences in excess of EUR 1 million that arise from the application of a particular principle or standard to items of income or expense or transactions that differs from the financial standard used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity.
## Article 3.2. Adjustments to Determine the Pillar Two Income or Loss

### 3.2.1

### 3.2.2 
At the election of the Filing Constituent Entity, a Constituent Entity may substitute in the computation of its Pillar Two Income or Loss the amount of stock-based compensation allowed as a deduction in the computation of its taxable income in the UAE for the amount expensed in its financial accounts for a cost or expense of such Constituent Entity that was paid with stock-based compensation, to the extent that such deduction is allowed under the Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022. If the stock-based compensation expense arises in connection with an option that expires without exercise, the Constituent Entity must include the total amount previously deducted in the computation of its Pillar Two Income or Loss for the Fiscal Year in which the option expires. The election is a Five-Year Election and must be applied consistently to the stock-based compensation of all Constituent Entities located in the UAE for the year.
### 3.2.3 Transactions between Constituent Entities are subject to the following:
- (a) when a transaction between Constituent Entities located in different Jurisdictions is not recorded in the same amount in the financial accounts of both Constituent Entities, or an asset is transferred at the disposing entity's carrying value or is not recorded consistently with the Arm's Length Principle, the Pillar Two Income or Loss of the Constituent Entities that are party to the transaction must be adjusted so that the transaction is recorded in the same amount and consistently with the Arm's Length Principle unless the adjustment is a unilateral adjustment and making such an adjustment would result in double taxation or double non-taxation under this Decision;
- (b) a loss from a sale or other transfer of an asset between two Constituent Entities located in the UAE that is not recorded consistent with the Arm's Length Principle shall be recomputed based on the Arm's Length Principle if that loss is included in the computation of Pillar Two Income or Loss;
- (c) rules for allocating income or loss between a Main Entity and its Permanent Establishments are found in Article 3.4.

### 3.2.4 
Qualified Refundable Tax Credits and Marketable Transferable Tax Credit shall be treated as income in the computation of Pillar Two Income or Loss of a Constituent Entity. Non-Qualified Refundable Tax Credits and Non-Marketable Transferable Tax Credits shall not be treated as income in the computation of Pillar Two Income or Loss of a Constituent Entity.

### 3.2.5 
With respect to assets and liabilities that are subject to fair value or impairment
## 3.2.6 
Where there is Aggregate Asset Gain in the UAE in a Fiscal Year, the Filing Constituent Entity may make, under this **Article 3.2.6**, an Annual Election for the UAE to adjust Pillar Two Income or Loss with respect to each previous Fiscal Year in the Look-back Period in the manner described in paragraphs (b) and (c) and to spread any remaining Adjusted Asset Gain over the Look-back Period in the manner described in paragraph (d). The Effective Tax Rate and Top-up Tax, if any, for any previous Fiscal Year must be re-calculated under **Article 5.4.1**. When an election is made under this Article:

(a) Covered Taxes with respect to any Net Asset Gain or Net Asset Loss in the Election Year shall be excluded from the computation of Adjusted Covered Taxes.

(b) The Aggregate Asset Gain in the Election Year shall be carried-back to the earliest Loss Year and set-off ratably against any Net Asset Loss of any
(c) If, for any Loss Year, the Adjusted Asset Gain exceeds the total amount of Net Asset Loss of all Constituent Entities located in the UAE, the Adjusted Asset Gain shall be carried forward to the following Loss Year (if any) and applied ratably against any Net Asset Loss of any Constituent Entity located in the UAE.

(d) Any Adjusted Asset Gain that remains after the application of paragraphs (b) and (c) shall be allocated evenly to each Fiscal Year in the Look-back Period. The Allocated Asset Gain for the relevant year shall be included in the computation of Pillar Two Income or Loss for a Constituent Entity located in the UAE in that year in accordance with the following formula:

$$
\text{Allocated Asset Gain for relevant year} \times \frac{\text{The specified Constituent Entity's Net Asset Gain in the Election Year}}{\text{The Net Asset Gain of all specified Constituent Entities in the Election Year}}
$$

For the purposes of the above formula, a specified Constituent Entity is a Constituent Entity that has Net Asset Gain in the Election Year and was located in the UAE in the relevant year. If there is no specified Constituent Entity for a relevant year the Adjusted Asset Gain allocated to that year will be allocated equally to each Constituent Entity in the UAE in that year.

### 3.2.7 
The computation of a Low-Tax Entity's Pillar Two Income or Loss shall exclude any expense attributable to an Intragroup Financing Arrangement that can reasonably be anticipated, over the expected duration of the arrangement to:

- (a) increase the amount of expenses taken into account in calculating the Pillar Two Income or Loss of the Low-Tax Entity;
- (b) without resulting in a commensurate increase in the taxable income of the High-Tax Counterparty. An amount received or receivable should not be treated as increasing the taxable income of a High-Tax Counterparty if it is eligible for an exclusion, exemption, deduction, credit or other tax benefit under local law and the amount of that benefit is calculated by reference to the amount received or receivable.
### 3.2.8 
An Ultimate Parent Entity may elect to apply its consolidated accounting treatment to eliminate income, expense, gains, and losses from transactions between Constituent Entities that are located, and included in a tax consolidation group, in the UAE for purposes of computing each such Constituent Entity's Net Pillar Two Income or Loss. The election under this Article is a Five-Year Election. Upon making or revoking such election, appropriate adjustments shall be made for the purposes of this Decision such that there shall not be duplications or omissions of items of Pillar Two Income or Loss as a result of having made or revoked the election.

### 3.2.9 
An insurance company shall exclude from the computation of Pillar Two Income or Loss amounts charged to policyholders for Taxes paid by the insurance company in respect of returns to the policy holders. An insurance company shall include in the computation of Pillar Two Income or Loss any returns to policyholders that are not reflected in Financial Accounting Net Income or Loss to the extent the corresponding increase or decrease in liability to the policyholders is reflected in its Financial Accounting Net Income or Loss.

### 3.2.10 
Amounts recognised as a decrease to the equity of a Constituent Entity attributable to distributions paid or payable in respect of Additional Tier One Capital and Restricted Tier One Capital issued by the Constituent Entity shall be treated as an expense in the computation of its Pillar Two Income or Loss. Amounts recognised as an increase to the equity of a Constituent Entity attributable to distributions received or receivable in respect of Additional Tier One Capital held by the Constituent Entity shall be included in the computation of its Pillar Two Income or Loss.

### 3.2.11 
A Constituent Entity's Financial Accounting Net Income or Loss must be adjusted as necessary to reflect the requirements of the relevant provisions of Articles 6 and 7.

### 3.2.12 
At the election of the Filing Constituent Entity, a Constituent Entity may exclude income attributable to a Qualified Debt Release from the computation of a Constituent Entity's Pillar Two Income or Loss.

### 3.2.13 
Notwithstanding Article 3.2.1(b), a Filing Constituent Entity may make a Five-Year Election for each Constituent Entity to include in the computation of Pillar Two Income all dividends with respect to Portfolio Shareholdings, regardless of whether these are Short-term Portfolio Shareholdings.
### 3.2.14 Notwithstanding Article 3.2.1(c), a Filing Constituent Entity may make a Five-Year Election to treat foreign exchange gains or losses as an Excluded Equity Gain or Loss, to the extent that:

- (a) such foreign exchange gains or losses are attributable to hedging instruments that hedge the currency exchange rate risk in Ownership Interests other than Portfolio Shareholdings;
- (b) such gain or loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income at the level of the Consolidated Financial Statements; and
- (c) the hedging instrument is considered an effective hedge under the Authorized Financial Accounting Standard used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

### 3.3.5 
The costs incurred by a Constituent Entity that are directly attributable to its international shipping activities listed in Article 3.3.2 and the costs directly attributable to its qualified ancillary activities listed in Article 3.3.3 shall be deducted from the Constituent Entity's revenues from such activities to compute its International Shipping Income and Qualified Ancillary International Shipping Income. Other costs incurred by a Constituent Entity that are indirectly attributable to a Constituent Entity's international shipping activities
and qualified ancillary activities shall be allocated on the basis of the Constituent Entity's revenues from such activities in proportion to its total revenues. All direct and indirect costs attributed to a Constituent Entity's International Shipping Income and Qualified Ancillary International Shipping Income shall be excluded from the computation of its Pillar Two Income or Loss.

The expenses used for computing Financial Accounting Net Income or Loss are those that are not deducted for taxable purposes in the Jurisdiction where the Main Entity is located and that are attributable to such operations.

#### 3.4.4 
The Financial Accounting Net Income or Loss of a Permanent Establishment is not taken into account in determining the Pillar Two Income or Loss of the Main Entity, except as provided in Article 3.4.5.

#### 3.4.5

is created, then the allocation of the tax credit under this provision shall follow 
such allocation made under the domestic laws.

## Article 4.5. The Pillar Two Loss Election

4.5.1 In lieu of applying the rules set forth in Article 4.4, a Filing Constituent Entity may make a Pillar Two Loss Election for the UAE. When a Pillar Two Loss Election is made for the UAE, a Pillar Two Loss Deferred Tax Asset is established in each Fiscal Year in which there is a Net Pillar Two Loss for the UAE. The Pillar Two Loss Deferred Tax Asset is equal to the Net Pillar Two Loss in a Fiscal Year for the UAE multiplied by the Minimum Rate.

4.5.2 The balance of the Pillar Two Loss Deferred Tax Asset is carried forward to subsequent Fiscal Years, reduced by the amount of Pillar Two Loss Deferred Tax Asset used in a Fiscal Year.

### 4.6.1 
An adjustment to a Constituent Entity's liability for Covered Taxes for a previous Fiscal Year, including one that derives from a loss carried-back, recorded in the financial accounts shall be treated as an adjustment to Covered Taxes in the Fiscal Year in which the adjustment is made, unless the adjustment relates to a Fiscal Year in which there is a decrease in Covered Taxes for the UAE. In the case of a decrease in Covered Taxes included in the Constituent Entity's Adjusted Covered Taxes for a previous Fiscal Year, the Effective Tax Rate and Top-up Tax for such Fiscal Year must be recalculated under Article 5.4.1. In the Article 5.4.1 recalculations, the Adjusted Covered Taxes determined for the Fiscal Year shall be reduced by the amount of the decrease in Covered Taxes and Pillar Two Income determined for the Fiscal Year and any intervening Fiscal Years shall be adjusted as necessary and appropriate. A Filing Constituent Entity may make an Annual Election to treat an immaterial decrease in Covered Taxes as an adjustment to Covered Taxes in the Fiscal Year in which the adjustment is made. An immaterial decrease in Covered Taxes is an aggregate decrease of less than EUR 1 million in the Adjusted Covered Taxes determined for the UAE for a Fiscal Year.

### 4.6.2 
The amount of deferred tax expense resulting from a reduction to the applicable domestic tax rate shall be treated as an adjustment under Article 4.6.1 to a Constituent Entity's liability for Covered Taxes claimed under Article 4.1 for a previous Fiscal Year when such reduction results in the application of a rate that is less than the Minimum Rate.

### 4.6.3 
The amount of deferred tax expense, when paid, that has resulted from an
4.6.4 If more than EUR 1 million of the amount accrued by a Constituent Entity as current tax expense and included in Adjusted Covered Taxes for a Fiscal Year is not paid within three years of the last day of such year, the Effective Tax Rate and Top-up Tax for the Fiscal Year in which the unpaid amount was claimed as a Covered Tax must be recalculated in accordance with Article 5.4.1 by excluding such unpaid amount from Adjusted Covered Taxes.

## Article 5 - Computation of Effective Tax Rate and Top-up Tax

For purposes of Article 5, each Stateless Constituent Entity subject to the provisions of this Decision shall be treated as if it was a single Constituent Entity located in the UAE.

5.1.2 The Net Pillar Two Income of the UAE for a Fiscal Year is the positive amount, if any, computed in accordance with the following formula:

$$
\text{Net Pillar Two Income} = \text{Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities} - \text{Pillar Two Losses of all Constituent Entities}
$$

5.2.3 The Top-up Tax for a Fiscal Year is equal to the positive amount, if any, computed in accordance with the following formula:

$Top-up Tax = (Top-up Tax Percentage \times Excess Profit) + Additional Current Top-up Tax$

Where:
- (a) The Top-up Tax Percentage is the percentage point difference determined in accordance with Article 5.2.1 for the Fiscal Year;
- (b) The Excess Profit is the Excess Profit determined in accordance with

$$
\text{Top up Tax of a Constituent Entity} = \text{Top up Tax} \times \frac{\text{Pillar Two Income of the Constituent Entity}}{\text{Aggregate Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities}}
$$
Where:

- (b) The Pillar Two Income of the Constituent Entity is the Pillar Two Income of the Constituent Entity located in the UAE determined in accordance with Article 3.2 for the Fiscal Year;
- (c) The aggregate Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities is the aggregate Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities located in the UAE that have Pillar Two Income for the Fiscal Year included in the computation of Net Pillar Two Income in accordance with Article 5.1.2.

### 5.2.5 
Where a Domestic Designated Filing Entity has not been appointed to pay the Top-up Tax, the Top-up Tax is attributable to a recalculation under Article 5.4.1 and there is no Net Pillar Two Income in the UAE for the current Fiscal Year, the Top-up Tax shall be allocated using the formula in Article 5.2.4 based on the Pillar Two Income of the Constituent Entities in the Fiscal Years for which the recalculations under Article 5.4.1 were performed.

### 5.2.6 
Where the Effective Tax Rate computed in accordance with Article 5.1.1 is less than zero and the Top-up Tax Percentage computed in accordance with Article 5.2.1 is above the Minimum Rate, the following provisions shall apply:

### 5.3.2 
The Substance-based Income Exclusion amount is the sum of the payroll carve-out and the tangible asset carve-out for each Constituent Entity, except for Constituent Entities that are Investment Entities, located in the UAE.

### 5.3.3 
The payroll carve-out for a Constituent Entity located in the UAE is equal to 5% of its Eligible Payroll Costs of Eligible Employees that perform activities for the MNE Group in the UAE, except Eligible Payroll costs that are:

For this purpose, the tangible asset carve-out computation shall not include the carrying value of property (including land or buildings) that is held for sale, lease or investment. The tangible asset carve-out computation shall not include the carrying value of tangible assets used in the generation of a Constituent Entity's International Shipping Income and Qualified Ancillary International Shipping Income (i.e. ships and other maritime equipment and infrastructure). The carrying value of tangible assets attributable to a Constituent Entity's excess income over the cap for Qualified Ancillary International Shipping Income under Article 3.3.4 shall be included in the tangible asset carve-out computation.
### 5.3.5 The computation of carrying value of Eligible Tangible Assets for purposes of Article 5.3.4 shall be based on the average of the carrying value (net of accumulated depreciation, amortisation, depletion, or impairment losses and including any amount attributable to capitalisation of payroll expense) at the beginning and ending of the Reporting Fiscal Year as recorded for the purposes of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity.

### 5.3.6 
For purposes of Articles 5.3.3 and 5.3.4, the Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets of a Constituent Entity that is a Permanent Establishment are those included in its separate financial accounts as determined by Article 3.4.1 and adjusted in accordance with Article 3.4.2, provided that the Eligible Employees and Eligible Tangible Assets are located in the Jurisdiction where the Permanent Establishment is located. The Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets of a Permanent Establishment are not taken into account for the Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets of the Main Entity.

### 5.3.8 
A Filing Constituent Entity may claim only a subset of the total Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets when calculating the Substance-based Income Exclusion amount under the provisions of this Decision.

### 5.3.9 
Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets attributable to income excluded under Article 7.2.1 shall be excluded from the computation of the Substance-based Income Exclusion. The amount excluded under this provision is equal to the total Eligible Payroll Costs and total carrying value of the Eligible Tangible Assets multiplied by the ratio of the Pillar Two Income excluded under Article 7.2.1 to the total Pillar Two Income determined for the Ultimate Parent Entity before the exclusion under Article 7.2.1.

(d) for purposes of paragraph (c), if the lessee is not a Constituent Entity, the lessee’s right-of-use asset shall be equal to the un-discounted amount of payments remaining due under the lease, including any extensions that would be taken into account in determining a right-of-use asset under the financial accounting standard used to determine the Financial Accounting Net Income or Loss of the lessor;

(e) in the case of a short-term rental asset, the lessee’s right-of-use asset shall be deemed to be nil;

(f) for purposes of paragraph (e), a short-term rental asset is an asset that is regularly leased several times to different lessees during the Fiscal Year and the average lease period, including any renewals and extensions, with respect to each lessee is 30 days or less.

The amount of Additional Current Top-up Tax allocated to each Constituent Entity for purposes of this Article shall be allocated only to Constituent Entities that record an Adjusted Covered Taxes amount that is less than zero and less than the Pillar Two Income or Loss of such Constituent Entity multiplied by the Minimum Rate. The allocation shall be made pro-rata based upon the following amount for each of those Constituent Entities:

$(Pillar Two Income or Loss \times Minimum Rate) - Adjusted Covered Taxes$

## Article 5.5. De minimis exclusion

### 5.5.1 
At the election of the Filing Constituent Entity, and notwithstanding the requirements otherwise provided in Article 5, the Top-up Tax for the Constituent Entities located in the UAE shall be deemed to be zero for a Fiscal Year if, for such Fiscal Year:

For this purpose, a Constituent Entity that indirectly owns an Ownership Interest in an Investment Entity through a direct Ownership Interest in another Investment Entity is considered to be subject to tax under a mark-to-market or similar regime with respect to the indirect Ownership Interest in the first-mentioned Entity if it is subject to a mark-to-market or similar regime with respect to the direct Ownership Interest in the second-mentioned Entity.

## Article 7.4. Taxable Distribution Method Election

### 7.4.1 
At the election of the Filing Constituent Entity, a Constituent Entity-owner located in the UAE that is not an Investment Entity may apply the Taxable Distribution Method with respect to its Ownership Interest in a Constituent Entity that is an Investment Entity if the Constituent Entity-owner can be reasonably expected to be subject to tax on distributions from the Investment Entity at a tax rate that equals or exceeds the Minimum Rate.

### 7.4.2 
Under the Taxable Distribution Method:

- distributions and deemed distributions of the Investment Entity's Pillar Two Income are included in the Pillar Two Income of the Constituent Entity-owner located in the UAE (other than an Investment Entity) that received the distribution;
- the Local Creditable Tax Gross-up is included in the Pillar Two Income and Adjusted Covered Taxes of the Constituent Entity-owner located in the UAE (other than an Investment Entity) that received the distribution; and
- the Constituent Entity-owner's proportionate share of the Investment Entity's Undistributed Net Pillar Two Income for the Tested Year is treated as Pillar Two Income of the Investment Entity for the Reporting Fiscal Year.

### 7.4.3 
The Undistributed Net Pillar Two Income for a Fiscal Year is the amount of the Investment Entity's Pillar Two Income, if any, for the Tested Year reduced (but not below zero) by:

- any Covered Taxes of the Investment Entity;
- distributions and deemed distributions to shareholders other than Constituent Entities that are Investment Entities in the Testing Period;
- Pillar Two Losses arising in the Testing Period; and
### (d) Investment Loss Carry-forwards.

#### 7.4.4 
Undistributed Net Pillar Two Income for the Tested Year cannot be reduced by distributions or deemed distributions to the extent that such distributions were treated as a reduction to Undistributed Net Pillar Two Income of a previous Tested Year. For purposes of computing Undistributed Net Pillar Two Income, a Pillar Two Loss is reduced to the extent it reduced Undistributed Net Pillar Two Income at the end of a previous Fiscal Year. If a Pillar Two Loss for a Fiscal Year is not reduced to zero before the end of the last Tested Period that includes such Fiscal Year, the remainder becomes an Investment Loss Carry-forward and is reduced in the same manner as a Pillar Two Loss in subsequent Fiscal Years.

#### 7.4.5 
For purposes of Article 7.4,
- (a) the Tested Year is the third year preceding the Reporting Fiscal Year;
- (b) the Testing Period is the period beginning with the first day of the Tested Year and ending with the last day of the Reporting Fiscal Year that the Ownership Interest was held by a Group Entity;
- (c) a deemed distribution arises when a direct or indirect Ownership Interest in the Investment Entity is transferred to a non-Group Entity and is equal to the proportionate share of the Undistributed Net Pillar Two Income attributable to such Ownership Interest on the date of such transfer (determined without regard to the deemed distribution); and
- (d) the Local Creditable Tax Gross-up is the amount of Covered Taxes incurred by the Investment Entity that is allowed as a credit against the Constituent Entity-owner's tax liability arising in connection with a distribution from the Investment Entity.

#### 7.4.6 
The election under this Article is a Five-Year Election. If the election is revoked, Constituent Entity-owner's proportionate share of the Investment Entity's Undistributed Net Pillar Two Income for the Tested Year at the end of the Fiscal Year preceding the revocation year is treated as Pillar Two Income of the Investment Entity for the revocation year.

#### 7.4.7 
The Investment Entity is not subject to this Decision on the Undistributed Net Pillar Two Income treated as Pillar Two Income.
## Article 7.5. Equity Investment Inclusion Election and Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefits

### Tax Benefits

7.5.1 A Filing Constituent Entity may make an Equity Investment Inclusion Election to include in the Pillar Two Income or Loss of a Constituent Entity, the accounting gain, profit, or loss with respect to any:

(a) fair value gains and losses and impairments on that Ownership Interest where the owner:
   i. is taxable on a mark-to-market basis or on the impairment, provided that the tax consequences of the mark-to-market movements or impairments on the Ownership Interests are reflected in the income tax expense; or
   ii. is taxable on a realization basis and the income tax expense includes deferred tax expense on the mark-to-market movements or impairments on the Ownership Interests;

(b) the profit and loss attributable to that Ownership Interest where the interest is in the Tax Transparent Entity and the owner accounts for the interest using the equity method; and

(c) the dispositions of that Ownership Interest which give rise to gains or losses that are included in the owner's domestic taxable income, excluding any gain fully offset, and the proportionate share of any gain partially offset, by any deduction or other similar relief particular to the type of gain.

7.5.2 The accounting gain, profit, or loss included in the Pillar Two Income or Loss pursuant to Article 7.5.1 shall be adjusted in accordance with Article 3.2 except for Article 3.2.1(c).

7.5.3 Notwithstanding Article 4.1.3 (a) and 4.4.1(a), where an Equity Investment Inclusion Election is made, all current and deferred tax expense or benefits that are derived from the accounting gain, profit, or loss included in the Pillar Two Income or Loss in accordance with Article 7.5.1 shall be included in the computation of Adjusted Covered Taxes subject to the relevant provisions of this Decision.

7.5.4 An owner subject to the Equity Investment Inclusion Election shall not apply Articles 7.5.1, 7.5.2 and 7.5.3 to a Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit that
flows through a Qualified Ownership Interest. Instead, the following provisions shall apply:

(a) the amount of a Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit will be allowed as a positive amount in the Adjusted Covered Taxes of the direct owner of a Qualified Ownership Interest or an indirect owner of such an interest through a chain of Tax Transparent Entities that are not Constituent Entities of the MNE Group to the extent the Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit was treated for financial accounting purposes as reducing a tax expense;

(b) the amount of a Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit is equal to the amount of the tax credit or tax-deductible loss that have flowed through to the owner through a Qualified Ownership Interest to the extent that it reduces the owner's investment in the Qualified Ownership Interest by:

i. the amount of such tax credit or tax loss;

ii. the amount of any distributions (including a return of capital) to the owner; or

iii. the amount of proceeds from a sale of all or part of the Qualified Ownership Interest.

(c) for the purposes of paragraph (b), a tax deductible loss is equal to the amount of the tax loss multiplied by the statutory rate applicable to the owner;

(d) the provisions of this Article 7.5.4 shall not cause the owner's investment to be less than zero and accordingly no amount shall be treated as reducing the investment to the extent it would reduce the investment below zero;

(e) where the owner's investment has been reduced to zero due to the obtention of tax credits or tax deductible losses through a Qualified Ownership Interest, or after receiving distributions (including a return of capital) or proceeds from the sale of all or part of the Qualified Ownership Interest:

i. any subsequent amount of any of tax credits or tax deductible losses obtained by the owner through a Qualified Ownership Interest shall be treated as a negative amount in the owner's Adjusted Covered Taxes; and
ii. any subsequent amount of any distributions (including a return of capital), proceeds from the sale of all or part of the Qualified Ownership Interest, or Qualified Refundable Tax Credits obtained through the Qualified Ownership Interest shall be treated as a negative amount in the owner’s Adjusted Covered Taxes to the extent of the amount of any Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit that flowed through the Qualified Ownership Interest and that were treated as a positive amount in the owner’s Adjusted Covered Taxes.

### 7.5.5 
An owner subject to Article 7.5.4 that uses the proportional amortization method to account for its Qualified Ownership Interest for financial accounting purposes shall apply such method for determining the amount of investment that is recovered each year. Owners that do not use the proportional amortization method may irrevocably elect to apply this methodology provided that the election is made in the first Fiscal Year in which they acquire the Qualified Ownership Interest or are subject to Pillar Two Rules.

### 7.5.6 
Where the proportional amortization method is applied in accordance with Article 7.5.5, any tax credit or tax loss that flows through or any distributions (including a return of capital) or proceeds from sales shall be treated as a reduction to the investment in proportion to the expected tax benefits ratio.

### 7.5.7 
The expected tax benefits ratio is the ratio of the tax credits and tax losses that flowed through or are received in the Fiscal Year to the total of such items that are expected to flow through or are received in respect of the Qualified Ownership Interest over the term of the investment.

### 7.5.8 
The amount of tax credits or tax losses that flow through or distributions (including a return of capital) or proceeds from sales received, in respect of the Qualified Ownership Interest, in excess of the reduction to the investment shall not be included as a positive amount in the owner’s Adjusted Covered Taxes.

### (e) the MNE Group uses data from different sources of Qualified Financial Statements for that same Entity or Permanent Establishment in the calculations required in Article 8.2.1.

### Article 9.1. Tax Attributes Upon Transition

9.1.1 When determining the Effective Tax Rate for the UAE in a Transition Year, and for each subsequent year, the MNE Group shall take into account all of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities reflected or disclosed in the financial accounts of all of the Constituent Entities in the UAE for the Transition Year. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities must be taken into account at the lower of the Minimum Rate or the applicable domestic tax rate. A deferred tax asset that has been recorded at a rate lower than the Minimum Rate may be taken into account at the Minimum Rate if the taxpayer can demonstrate that the deferred tax asset is attributable to a Pillar Two Loss. For purposes of applying this Article, the impact of any valuation adjustment, or accounting recognition adjustment with respect to a deferred tax asset is disregarded.

9.1.2 Deferred tax assets arising from items excluded from the computation of Pillar Two Income or Loss under Article 3, including those that derive from deductions that are not allowed for accounting purposes, must be excluded from the Article 9.1.1 computation when such deferred tax assets are generated in a transaction that takes place after 30 November 2021.

9.1.3 In the case of a domestic or cross-border transfer of assets between Constituent Entities after 30 November 2021 and before the commencement of a Transition Year, the Pillar Two tax basis in the acquired assets (other than inventory) shall be based upon the disposing Entity's carrying value of the transferred assets upon disposition with the deferred tax assets and liabilities brought into the application of the Pillar Two Rules determined on that basis.

9.1.4 For purposes of Article 9.1.1:
- (a) a deemed deferred tax asset from losses that have not been recognised
(b) the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities shall not be subject to any adjustments under Article 4.4.1(a), (b), (c), or (d), or Article 4.4.4, except for the adjustments referred to in Article 9.1.2;

(c) notwithstanding Article 4.4.1(e), deferred tax assets that derive from a tax credit carry-forward shall be taken into account and their amount shall be equal to the deferred tax assets accrued in the financial accounts if the tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets is below the Minimum Rate or, in any other case, such deferred tax assets shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:

| Deferred tax assets in the financial accounts | $x$ | Minimum Rate |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----|--------------|
| Applicable domestic tax rate                  |     |              |

Where:

(a) Deferred tax assets in the financial accounts means the deferred tax assets reflected or disclosed in the financial accounts attributable to a tax credit carry-forward arising in the UAE.

(b) the change in the amount of the deferred tax asset resulting from re-application of the formula in Article 9.1.5 shall not be treated as deferred tax expense included in the computation of Adjusted Covered Taxes in the re-application year; and

(c) the deferred tax expense for the re-application year and subsequent years shall be determined by reference to the amount of the reversal of the deferred tax asset after re-application of the formula in Article 9.1.5.
### 9.1.6 
The Transition Year referred to in Article 9.1.3 is the Transition Year of the disposing Constituent Entity. The Transition Year of the disposing Constituent Entity is the first year in which its low-taxed income becomes subject to charge under the Pillar Two Rules irrespective of when other Constituent Entities in the UAE are subject to the Pillar Two Rules.

### 9.1.7 
For purposes of Article 9.1.3, a transfer of assets includes but is not limited to:

- (a) any transfer of rights to an item of economic value in which the acquiring Entity creates or increases the carrying value of an asset in its financial accounts and the disposing Entity recognises the corresponding amount of income after 30 November 2021 and before the commencement of a Transition Year;
- (b) transfers or deemed transfers of assets within the same Entity;
- (c) sale of an asset;
- (d) capital leases, which are accounted for in the same or similar manner as a purchase of an asset;
- (e) licenses that are effectively treated as a sale for accounting purposes;

(b) any increased depreciation or amortization attributable to recording assets at fair value in the financial accounting of the acquiring Entity must be excluded from the computation of the Pillar Two Income or Loss; and

(c) where an acquiring Constituent Entity recorded the asset acquired at fair value in its financial accounts, it may instead use the carrying value of that asset reflected in its financial accounts in all subsequent years if it would otherwise be entitled to take into account a deferred tax asset equal to the Minimum Rate multiplied by the difference in the local tax basis in the asset and the Pillar Two carrying value of the asset determined under Article 9.1.3.

### 9.1.10 
For purposes of Article 9.1.1, any deferred tax asset or liability arising in the financial accounts used for the computation of the Pillar Two Income or Loss as a result of a transaction described in Article 9.1.3 shall be disregarded except where and to the extent that:

(a) a Covered Tax was paid by:
    i. the disposing Entity; or
    ii. a member of the disposing Entity's domestic consolidated tax group; and

(b) any deferred tax assets that would have been recognised under Article 9.1.1 by the disposing Constituent Entity with respect to the assets transferred had the transaction in Article 9.1.3 not occurred.

For purposes of the exception in Article 9.1.10:

(a) The MNE Group has the burden of proving:
    i. the amount of tax paid in respect of the transaction;

(c) the deferred tax asset referred to in Article 9.1.6 shall not reduce the Adjusted Covered Taxes of a Constituent Entity; and

(d) the deferred tax asset referred to in Article 9.1.6 shall be adjusted annually in proportion to any decrease in the carrying value of the asset for the year.

### 9.1.12 The following provisions apply where the Top-up Tax applies to Constituent Entities in the UAE in a Fiscal Year that begins on or before the Fiscal Year that a Qualified IIR or Qualified UTPR first become applicable to those Constituent Entities:

(a) the Fiscal Year that the Qualified IIR or Qualified UTPR came into effect for such Constituent Entities will be the new Transition Year and the attributes of those Constituent Entities will be reset in accordance with the other provisions of this Article;

(b) any excess negative tax expense carry-forward under Article 4.1.6 or Article 5.2.6 shall be eliminated at the beginning of the new Transition Year;

(c) Article 4.4.4 shall not apply to any deferred tax liability that was taken into account in computing the Effective Tax Rate under the provisions of the Top-up Tax and that was not recaptured prior to the new Transition Year, but it shall apply to deferred tax liabilities that are taken into account in and after the new Transition Year;

## Article 18.2. Definitions of Flow-through Entity, Tax Transparent Entity, Reverse Hybrid Entity, and Hybrid Entity
### 18.2.1 
An Entity is a **Flow-through Entity** to the extent it is fiscally transparent with respect to its income, expenditure, profit or loss in the Jurisdiction where it was created unless it is tax resident and subject to a Covered Tax on its income or profit in another Jurisdiction.

- (a) A Flow-Through Entity is a **Tax Transparent Entity** with respect to its income, expenditure, profit or loss to the extent that it is fiscally transparent in the Jurisdiction in which its owner is located.
- (b) A Flow-Through Entity is a **Reverse Hybrid Entity** with respect to its income, expenditure, profit or loss to the extent that it is not fiscally transparent in
## the Jurisdiction in which the owner is located.

18.2.2 An Entity is treated as fiscally transparent under the laws of a Jurisdiction, if that Jurisdiction treats the income, expenditure, profit or loss of that Entity as if it were derived or incurred by the direct owner of that Entity in proportion to its interest in that Entity.

18.2.3 An Ownership Interest in an Entity or a Permanent Establishment that is a Constituent Entity shall be treated as held through a **Tax Transparent Structure** if that Ownership Interest is held indirectly through a chain of Tax Transparent Entities.

18.2.4 A Constituent Entity that is not a tax resident and not subject to a Covered Tax or a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax based on its place of management, place of creation, or similar criteria shall be treated as a Flow-Through Entity and a Tax Transparent Entity in respect of its income, expenditure, profit or loss to the extent that:

*   (a) its owners are located in a Jurisdiction that treats the Entity as fiscally transparent;
*   (b) it does not have a place of business in the Jurisdiction where it was created; and
*   (c) the income, expenditure, profit or loss is not attributable to a Permanent Establishment.

18.2.5 An Entity that is treated as a separate taxable person for income tax purposes in the Jurisdiction where it is located is a **Hybrid Entity** with respect to its income, expenditure, profit or loss to the extent that it is fiscally transparent in the Jurisdiction in which its owner is located.

## Article 18.3. Location of an Entity and a Permanent Establishment

18.3.1 The location of an Entity that is not a Flow-through Entity is determined as follows:

*   (a) if it is a tax resident in a Jurisdiction based on its place of management, place of creation or similar criteria, it is located in that Jurisdiction; and
*   (b) in other cases, it is located in the Jurisdiction in which it was created.

18.3.2 The location of an Entity that is a Flow-through Entity is determined as follows:
## 18.3.3 
The location of a Permanent Establishment is determined as follows:
- (a) if it is described in paragraph (a) of the definition in Article 18.1, is located in the Jurisdiction where it is treated as a permanent establishment and is taxed under the applicable Tax Treaty in force;
- (b) if it is described in paragraph (b) of the definition in Article 18.1, is located in the Jurisdiction where it is subject to net basis taxation based on its business presence;
- (c) if it is described in paragraph (c) of the definition in Article 18.1, is located in the Jurisdiction where it is situated; and
- (d) if it is described in paragraph (d) of the definition in Article 18.1, is considered as a stateless Permanent Establishment.

## 18.3.4 
Where by reason of Article 18.3.1, a Constituent Entity is located in more than one Jurisdiction (a dual-located Entity), then its status for a Fiscal Year for purposes of this Decision shall be determined as follows:
- (a) if it is located in two Jurisdictions that have an applicable Tax Treaty in force:
  - (i) it shall be located in the Jurisdiction where it is considered as a deemed resident for purposes of the Tax Treaty;
  - (ii) if the Tax Treaty requires the competent authorities to reach a mutual agreement on the deemed residence of the Constituent Entity for purposes of the Tax Treaty and no agreement exists, then paragraph (b) shall apply;
  - (iii) if the Tax Treaty does not provide relief or exemption from tax because the Constituent Entity is a tax resident of both Contracting Parties, then paragraph (b) shall apply;
- (b) if no Tax Treaty applies, then its location shall be determined as follows:
  - (i) it shall be located in the Jurisdiction where it paid the greater amount of Covered Taxes for the Fiscal Year, without considering the ones paid in accordance with a Controlled Foreign Company Tax Regime;
  - (ii) if the amount of Covered Taxes paid in all Jurisdictions is the same or zero, it shall be located in the Jurisdiction where it has the greater amount of
### Substance-based Income Exclusion computed on an entity basis in accordance with Article 5.3;

(iii) if the amount of the Substance-based Income Exclusion in all Jurisdictions is the same or zero, then it is considered a Stateless Constituent Entity unless it is the Ultimate Parent Entity of the MNE Group in which case it shall be located in the Jurisdiction where it was created.

#### 18.3.5 
Where, under Article 18.3.4, a dual-located Entity that is a Parent Entity is located in a Jurisdiction where it is not subject to a Qualified IIR, then the other Jurisdiction(s) can require such Entity to apply its Qualified IIR unless it is restricted by an applicable Tax Treaty in force.

#### 18.3.6 
Where an Entity has changed its location during the Fiscal Year, it shall be located in the Jurisdiction where it was located at the beginning of that year.
